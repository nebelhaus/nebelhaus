# Hush — quiet as a switch. One toggle (bar pill · palette command · `hush`
# CLI) that turns macOS Do Not Disturb on/off, optionally sets your Slack
# status + snoozes Slack push, and runs host hooks. All surfaces call the one
# engine script this module builds, so they can never disagree.
#
# The trick: Apple ships no public API to set a Focus — every "focus CLI" in
# the wild is a Shortcuts wrapper. Instead, this module makes the binding
# itself declarative: it writes symbolic hotkey 175 ("Turn Do Not Disturb
# On/Off" — present on every Mac, disabled and buried in Settings) to an
# obscure chord at activation, and the engine presses that chord
# synthetically. No Shortcuts app, nothing to author by hand.
#
# TCC honesty: the synthetic keypress needs Accessibility on whatever app
# invokes hush (palette runs inherit pounce's grant; the pill needs sketchybar
# granted once), and exact state reads of Assertions.json need Full Disk
# Access — without it hush falls back to remembering its own last toggle.
# `hush doctor` checks and explains all of it.
