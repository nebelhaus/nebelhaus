# The static AeroSpace bindings — the tiling/workspace/service chords that are
# the SAME on every install (the per-app launcher chords live in the roster,
# nebelhaus.prowl.apps). Declared ONCE here, then rendered two ways:
#
#   modules/prowl/default.nix   → the `binds` become aerospace.toml lines
#                                 (@MAIN_STATIC@ / @SERVICE_STATIC@ tokens).
#   modules/pounce/default.nix  → the `keys`/`action` become cheatsheet rows.
#
# Because both artifacts come from this one table, a binding and its cheatsheet
# caption can't disagree — editing the chord here moves both in lockstep. This
# is what killed the class of drift that commit 9abf899 had to fix by hand.
#
# Each item:
#   keys    display string for the cheatsheet (human-friendly, may fold several
#           chords into one row like "⌥ hjkl"). Omit for a toml-only binding.
#   action  cheatsheet caption. Omit alongside keys for a toml-only binding.
#   binds   attrset of aerospace chord → command. The command is a string, or a
#           list of strings for a multi-command binding (e.g. ["join-with left"
#           "mode main"]). Omit for a display-only row (e.g. the app-workspace
#           throws, whose chords are generated from the roster). @HOME@/@BIN@
#           tokens are substituted by modules/prowl at build time.
#
# Each section: title (cheatsheet heading), optional mode ("main" default, or
# "service" → rendered under [mode.service.binding]).
