        Replace the stock ⌘Tab app switcher with pounce's MRU *window* switcher:
        tap ⌘⇥ to toggle to the last window (across workspaces), hold ⌘ and keep
        tapping ⇥ to walk older ones, type while holding to fuzzy-filter
        (frecency-ranked). Rows carry the window's AeroSpace workspace, and
        focusing goes through `aerospace focus --window-id` so a window parked
        on another workspace surfaces correctly.

        Needs the daemon to hold an Accessibility grant — in practice, set
        nebelhaus.pounce.signingIdentity so the grant survives rebuilds. Without
        the grant the event tap can't install and stock ⌘Tab keeps working, so
        this default is safe on a fresh, not-yet-granted install. false leaves
        ⌘Tab native even when the grant is there.

      description = ''
        A code-signing identity in your login keychain — either its SHA-1 or
        (preferred) its full common name. The pounce daemon is re-signed with
        it so a macOS Accessibility (TCC) grant survives rebuilds. List yours:
          security find-identity -v -p codesigning

        Prefer a "Developer ID Application" identity passed BY NAME (e.g.
        "Developer ID Application: Jane Doe (TEAMID)"): its designated
        requirement anchors on the stable team OU, so the grant survives even
        a certificate renewal (the renewed cert keeps the same name/team but
        gets a new SHA — a hardcoded SHA would silently fall back to unsigned).
        This is also the identity the Homebrew build is signed with, so both
        install paths share one identity. An "Apple Development" cert works too
        but expires yearly and pins the specific cert, so it's less durable.

        Changing this once invalidates the existing grant (the requirement
        changes) — re-approve pounce in Accessibility a single time after.

        Leave empty to run pounce unsigned (the palette works, but auto-paste
        and other Accessibility-gated features stay off).
