# grant survives rebuilds — a store path's adhoc cdhash changes every build,
# losing any grant keyed to it. The nix sandbox can't reach the login keychain,
# so when you provide `nebelhaus.pounce.signingIdentity` we sign impurely here in
# the Aqua session: copy Pounce.app to a fixed writable path, codesign it with
# that identity (a Developer ID cert by name gives the most durable designated
# requirement → grant persists across rebuilds and cert renewals), and exec the
# daemon from that copy. A marker records which store
# path the copy was signed from, so we only re-sign when pounce actually changed.
