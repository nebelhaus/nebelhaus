# The build/switch itself is `haus rebuild` — the same end-user CLI the whole
# rice hands people (and that add-app.sh already reuses), so the palette and the
# terminal agree on exactly one rebuild path. haus resolves the flake's host attr
# at runtime, so this command no longer bakes in a `@hostname@`. The flake lives
# at ~/.config/nix by convention; override with $NEBELHAUS_FLAKE (mapped to
# haus's own $HAUS_CONSUMER below) if yours is elsewhere.
#
# The floating window is spawned by the shared float-term helper
# (hearth/zellij/float-term.sh) — the single implementation of the macOS
# "fresh Ghostty instance → PID-diff → AppleScript-settle → aerospace-float"
# dance, reused by peek and the agent-peek popup too. This command's only job
# is to build the rebuild payload and hand it off.
