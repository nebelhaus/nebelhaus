# Rice-specific counterpart to pounce's built-in "Report Pounce Issue": opens

# template. Shipped by the rice (modules/pounce/commands, layered in via
# extraCommandDirs), so it only appears when pounce is used with nebelhaus.
# Same URL-query approach as the pounce built-in — nothing hosted needed.
