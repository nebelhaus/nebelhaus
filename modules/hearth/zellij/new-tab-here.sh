#!/bin/bash
# new-tab-here.sh — open a new zellij tab cwd'd at the CURRENTLY FOCUSED pane's
# directory. Bound to Super-Shift-t (config.kdl). Runs briefly, as a throwaway
# 1%-corner floating pane, INSIDE the current session: it inherits the focused
# pane's cwd as $PWD and already has $ZELLIJ, so `zellij action` targets this
# session with no `-s <session>` needed.
#
# `zellij action new-tab --cwd` is silently ignored under our custom
# default_tab_template, so clone the active layout (custom.kdl) and inject a
# tab-level cwd — the only form zellij honors. Same trick as peek-run.sh's
# spawn_tab and the link-handler. The tab is named after its git root (or the
# dir basename), matching the auto-rename the shell does on cd.
#
# Note: if the focused pane sits in an agent worktree (~/.cache/claude-worktrees),
# the tab is aimed at the repo's MAIN checkout — cwd and name both. The new
# tab's fresh shell would hop there anyway (hearth's zshrc), but the name is
# stamped from here before that shell exists, so without the pre-hop the tab
# kept the agent's throwaway checkout name while its shell sat in the main
# repo. The "stay in the worktree" spawns are Super-Shift-p and the peek
# Enter-on-dir tab, which set $ZJ_STAY; this one deliberately does not.
