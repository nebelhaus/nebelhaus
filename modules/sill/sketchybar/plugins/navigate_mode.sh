# navigate_mode.sh on|off
#
# Indicator for AeroSpace's `navigate` mode (entered via the launch leader's
# arrows). Recolors the front-app pill catppuccin sky and appends a four-way
# move glyph to the end of the app name. `off` restores the normal lavender pill
# and the bare app name. Mirrors resize_mode.sh (see it for the front_app pill
# it recolors).
#
# A state file (STATE) records that the mode is armed: front_app.sh reads it so
# that moving focus around the workspace (which fires front_app_switched and
# repaints the label) keeps the glyph instead of dropping it. Because navigate
# mode's whole job is moving focus, that repaint fires constantly — the state
# check is what keeps the pill from flickering back to normal mid-navigate.
