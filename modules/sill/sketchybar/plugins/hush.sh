# The hush pill: bell = listening, struck bell on mauve = hushed. All logic
# lives in the hush engine (modules/hush → ~/.local/bin/hush); this script
# only relays clicks and renders state. Kept honest three ways: the engine
# fires hush_change after its own toggles, the hush-watcher launchd agent
# fires it when the Focus DB changes (Control Center / iPhone), and
# update_freq polls as a backstop.
