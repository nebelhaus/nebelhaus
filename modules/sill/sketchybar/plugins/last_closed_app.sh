# last_closed_app.sh — recorder for "reopen last closed app" (the browser ⌘⇧T
# analog, bound to the caps→z leader).
#
# Runs off macOS's front_app_switched event — the same cheap signal
# empty_workspace.sh uses. Each event records the frontmost app's pid + bundle
# id; on the NEXT event, if that pid is now dead the app was QUIT, so its bundle
# id is pushed onto a stack. reopen-last-app.sh (deployed by prowl, bound to
# caps→z) pops the stack and `open -b`s the app back — press z again to walk
# further back, exactly like ⌘⇧T reopening successively older closed tabs.
#
# Non-drawing item, subscribed to front_app_switched in sketchybarrc. Frontmost
# is read via lsappinfo (≈8ms), not osascript (≈110ms) — this runs every event.
