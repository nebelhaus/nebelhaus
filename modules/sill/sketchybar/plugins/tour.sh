#
# The haus tour — the first-run tutor. One quiet pill at the FAR RIGHT of the
# bar (tour_item.sh --move's it next to the clock, so a notch can never cover
# it) walks the four moves (launch / navigate / resize / palette): no focus
# steal, no key logging, and no window of its own — except the "haus tour"
# buddy Finder window steps 2-3 spawn when the workspace is too empty to
# demonstrate on (see buddy_open). Completion is detected from signals the rice
# already fires — the leader-mode scripts and aerospace-notify.sh call
# `tour.sh event <name>`, each guarded by a single `[ -f $STATE ]`, so an idle
# machine pays one stat per mode change and nothing else. We verify the
# RESULTING state (mode entered, workspace changed), never the keystroke.
#
# Steps are strictly sequential:
#   1a  tap caps (launch mode armed)          <- launch_mode.sh on
#   1b  press a letter (an app launches)      <- aerospace-notify.sh (workspace
#                                                changed). The named key is
#                                                picked to point AWAY from the
#                                                focused workspace (launch_key),
#                                                so pressing it always moves you
#                                                and fires the event — otherwise
#                                                a key that lands on the CURRENT
#                                                workspace never fires and the
#                                                step hangs (click the pill to
#                                                skip if it somehow still can't).
#   2   caps + arrow (navigate mode)          <- navigate_mode.sh on
#   3   caps + -/=   (resize mode)            <- resize_mode.sh on
#   4   ⌘Space, type tour                     <- the pounce "Haus Tour" command
#                                                (skipped when pounce is off)
#
# Left-click skips the current step (dormant: starts), right-click dismisses
# for good. Entry points: the dormant "new here?" hint on a fresh machine,
# `haus tour`, and the pounce command — which doubles as step 4's detection,
# so the palette finishes its own tutorial.
#
# State: $STATE holds the current step; $DONE present == completed or
# dismissed — it's what keeps the dormant hint from ever coming back. `reset`
# clears both and re-arms the hint. $MUTED lists the right-side pills hidden
# while a tour runs (see mute/unmute).
#
# Concurrency: caps->letter can fire `launch` and `workspace` back to back as
# fire-and-forget processes, so every mutation runs under the same mkdir-lock
# trick launch_mode.sh uses. The "nice" flash sleeps WHILE holding the lock on
# purpose: a queued event blocks until the flash lands, then reads the settled
# step. The steal window (~5s) stays above the longest flash (4s).

# launchers) bound to a workspace that ISN'T the focused one. Recomputed at
# render time, not cached, so it stays right if the user drifts workspaces mid-
# step. Fall back to the roster's first app key when every app sits on the
# focused workspace or aerospace is mute — the click-to-skip escape still covers
# that corner. LAUNCHERS ("<key>:<ws>" pairs) and LAUNCHER_KEYS come from the
# roster in workspaces.sh, the same source launch_mode.sh's picker reads.
