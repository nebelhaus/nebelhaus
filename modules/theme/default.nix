# Theme — the desktop wallpaper. The accent (nebelhaus.theme.accent) lives in
# options.nix and is consumed per-tool by hearth/sill/pounce; this room owns the
# one whole-desktop surface those don't touch: the wallpaper behind everything.
#
# Four Nebelung looks (nebelhaus.theme.wallpaper):
#   orbits · constellation · flow  — hand-made PNGs, the palette baked in
#   bold                           — GENERATED from theme.accent, so it follows
#                                    the accent (a bold pink at accent = "pink")
#   none (default)                 — leave whatever wallpaper you already have
#
# Set via osascript at each home-manager activation. Changing the desktop is a
# visible, personal thing, so the default is `none`: nothing moves unless a host
# (or the bootstrap interview) opts in.
