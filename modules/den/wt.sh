# wt — manage Claude Code agent worktrees, for ANY git repo.
#
# `claude --worktree` (the Super-c / ⌘C zellij bind) fires Claude Code's
# WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks; this script is what they call. It keeps
# agent checkouts under ~/.cache/claude-worktrees/<repo>/<name> (out of the repo
# so trees stay clean) on branch worktree-<name>, and — crucially — makes
# closing a pane safe and reversible:
#
#   wt                list every parked/live agent worktree, across ALL repos
#                     (self-heals first: reaps parked branches whose PR has merged)
#   wt <name>         resume one: rebuild its checkout + reopen its Claude chat
#   wt resume <name>  (the same thing, spelled out)
#   wt reap           sweep every LANDED worktree NOW — parked ones, plus clean &
#                     merged live checkouts (dirty/unmerged/your-own-pane are kept).
#                     The idempotent backstop for when a pane ends WITHOUT firing
#                     the remove hook (a `/ship` close-pane, a reboot, a crash) or
#                     for `wt child` checkouts, which the hook never reaps.
#   wt child <repo>   make a worktree of ANOTHER repo as a child of THIS pane —
#                     for cross-repo work (a workshop pane editing a sub-repo).
#                     Registers it so its PR shows in the statusline; prints the
#                     new checkout path, so: cd "$(wt child ~/code/…/rice)"
#   wt create         [hook] make a worktree for the current repo (JSON on stdin)
#   wt remove         [hook] retire one WITHOUT losing work (JSON on stdin)
#
